# Analyzing Climate Change Data

The purpose of this project is to use PySpark and data analysis techniques to investigate causes of climate change by looking closely at trends and changes amongst the commonly attributed factors of global warming.

Researchers emphasize the long term changes certain activities, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, can have on our environment and global climate. Recently, with increasing frequency, there have been cases of temperatures exceeding recorded highs, along with conditions that make it favorable for intense wildfires to occur. For example, the Canadian wildfires of 2023 have already caused the most land damage compared to those of previous wildfire seasons. We ultimately want to see how the data translates to the trends commonly associated with climate change.

We use data on average monthly temperatures, data on CO2 emission levels, and data on climate events and natural disasters. Each dataset is converted to a PySpark DataFrame so that we can take advantage of the efficiency of using Spark for large datasets, along with the simplicity brought by the Python API, and access to SQL-like operations to help us transform and query our data. We also use some helpful libraries: sklearn (scikitlearn) to perform basic data analysis, and matplotlib, to visualize our data.

Some of the visualizations created are shown below:
